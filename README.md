📉 Dimensionality Reduction for Property Price Prediction – PCA

📌 Abstract

Accurately predicting property sale prices is a challenge for sellers, buyers, and investors. Property prices are influenced by multiple features such as area, basement size, year built, number of bedrooms, and more.
While more features can potentially improve accuracy, high-dimensional data can lead to complexity, redundancy, and overfitting. This project applies dimensionality reduction techniques to retain essential information while reducing predictors, resulting in more efficient modeling and clearer insights.


🎯 Problem Statement

Reduce the number of predictors in a property dataset while preserving essential information to improve visualization, model efficiency, and interpretability.

⸻

⚙ Approach

Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dataset dimensions while retaining maximum variance for better downstream prediction performance.

Tools & Libraries:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn

⸻

🔑 Key Steps
	•	⚖ Feature Scaling – Standardized the dataset to ensure all variables contribute equally.
	•	🔍 PCA Transformation – Reduced high-dimensional data into principal components.
	•	📊 Variance Analysis – Visualized explained variance ratio to decide the number of components to retain.
	•	🎨 Visualization – Plotted 2D & 3D projections using the top principal components.
	•	📈 Impact Assessment – Analyzed the effect of dimensionality reduction on model efficiency and interpretability.

⸻

🏆 Outcome

Successfully reduced the dataset to fewer dimensions without significant loss of information, improving:
	•	✅ Model training efficiency
	•	✅ Data visualization clarity
	•	✅ Feature interpretability
