Dimensionality Reduction Technique


ABSTRACT : A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the property. The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for property investors as well as for buyers to plan their finances according to the price trend. The property prices depend on the number of features like the property area, basement square footage, year built, number of bedrooms, and others. The prices can be predicted more accurately if the number of predictors is less. Several dimension reduction techniques are being applied to decrease this number of predictors.


PROBLEM STATEMENT : A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the property. The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for property investors as well as for buyers to plan their finances according to the price trend. The property prices depend on the number of features like the property area, basement square footage, year built, number of bedrooms, and others. The prices can be predicted more accurately if the number of predictors is less. Several dimension reduction techniques are being applied to decrease this number of predictors.


APPROACH : To reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving the most important information for better visualization and model efficiency.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Key Steps:
	•	Standardized the dataset using feature scaling to ensure all variables contribute equally.
	•	Applied PCA to transform high-dimensional data into principal components.
	•	Visualized explained variance ratio to determine the number of components to retain.
	•	Plotted 2D and 3D projections of the data using the top principal components.
	•	Analyzed how dimensionality reduction impacts interpretability and performance of downstream models.

 
Outcome:Effectively reduced the dataset to fewer dimensions, improving model efficiency and providing better insight into data structure without significant loss of information.
